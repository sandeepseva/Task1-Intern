Excited to share the successful completion of Task 2 for my Apex Planet Software Pvt Ltd internship! This phase, focused on Intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my front-end development skills.

Throughout this task, I gained hands-on experience in:

Building a Contact Form: Developing robust forms using HTML and styling them effectively with CSS, preparing for user interaction.
Implementing JavaScript Form Validation: Ensuring data integrity by adding client-side validation to the forms, covering required fields and correct email formats.
Creating Responsive Layouts: Mastering responsive web design principles by structuring pages with Flexbox and CSS Grid for optimal viewing across various screen sizes.
Developing Dynamic Web Elements: Enhancing user experience through DOM manipulation with JavaScript, demonstrated by building a dynamic to-do list or an image gallery where content can be added and removed.
This task has significantly bolstered my practical knowledge in creating interactive and accessible web applications. I'm incredibly grateful for the continuous learning experience at Apex Planet!
